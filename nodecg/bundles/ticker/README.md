ticker is a [NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg) bundle. 
It works with NodeCG versions which satisfy this [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning) range: `^1.1.1`
You will need to have an appropriate version of NodeCG installed to use it.

Also requires the mindcrackmarathon bundle for graphics, as this bundle does not create any of its own.
